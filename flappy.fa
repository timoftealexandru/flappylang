#Here's an example of a program which computes a factorial:

n := 5;
p := 1;
while n > 0 do
  p := p * n;
  n := n - 1
end;

#Assignment statements (all variables are global and can only store integers):

x := 1;

#Conditional statements:

if x = 1 then
  y := 2
else
  y := 3
end;

#While loops:

while x < 10 do
  x := x + 1
end;

#Compound statements (separated by semicolons):

x := 1;
y := 2
